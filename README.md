# simple-txt-to-command-code
Executes the commands from commands.txt to the console as CMD commands.

As I started downloading Forza Horizon 4, I got this idea which was quite an easy job to be done. Anyways, don't complain about how shitty this is, as it gets the job done for those who need this if anyone.





NOTE:
if you'd like to run this program you need to have these DLL files to run this program ever since I've started to use code blocks. It uses the MinGW GCC compiler. It's not necessary to use the commands.txt it's just which commands I've been using so far while testing this application.
